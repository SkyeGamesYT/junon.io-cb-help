Trigger (MobDestroyed)

  IfThenElse
    If
      $entityType
      =
      Slime [can be any mob, I used slime for this example]
   Then
   + Commands
  /spawnmob slime 1 $random(2,41) $random(57,84) attackables:players taming:false status:hostile
  
  This makes it so that a mob will spawn between (2,57) and (41,84) You can change the cords, these are just preset ones. (x1,x2) (y1,y2) for template.

if you want them to spawn anywhere, use /spawnmob slime 1 $random(0,127) $random(0,127) .
