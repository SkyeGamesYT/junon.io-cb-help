Part 1:

There are 2 choices to this.

1. Have this on the PlayerJoin
If on the PlayerJoin; then create a list of your sidebar commands under:
PlayerJoin

+ Commands

Sidebar Exapmles. (What I have for my game)

/sidebar set 1 §e Welcome To CottageCore Simulated RPG
/sidebar set 2 §c ----------
/sidebar set 3 §6 How to play:

-- And So on..

2nd Choice.

Instead of PlayerJoin, use WorldLoaded. Then repeat command steps above.

Once done with sidebar commands; use the command /timer start {any name} {1-3} -- 1-3 is the amount of time between color change.

Part 2: 
(Trigger): TimerStart
  IfThenElse
    If
      $name
      =
      {name of timer, I used ScoreboardChange}
 Then
 + Commands
 
 {paste same sidebar commands, make sure they are in correct order.}
 
 Part 3:
 
 (Trigger): TimerEnd
 IfThenElse
    If
      $name
      =
      {use same timer for TimerStart, Once again I used ScoreboardChange}
  Then
  
  + Commands
  
  {paste same sidebar commands from above, but make sure to change the §{color} so it works, use https://junonio.fandom.com/wiki/Sidebar_(command) }
  
  Part 4:
  After done with sidebar, use /timer start {final time to put the timer name, I kept ScoreboardChange} {same duration, 1-3. I used 2}
  
  Thats it! It should work.
  To Start it, Re-join the world if you have WorldLoaded, or wait for someone to join if you have PlayerJoined.
