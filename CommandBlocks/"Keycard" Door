Trigger (InteractBuilding)

IfThenElse
  If
    $entityId
    =
    [id of selaed door you want to make become a keycard, make sure all roles can not open the door]
Then
  IfThenElse
    If
      $getEquip($player)
      =
      [item you want to use as keycard, I used survival tool]
Then
  + Commands
      /interact [door id] open
      
      
      Note. I suggest making the door close after player exit with a region. The code for that is below
      
 Trigger (RegionLeave)
 
  IfThenElse
    If
      $region
      =
      [name of region for door, I just used "door"]
   Then
   + Commands
        /interact [door id] close
        
        -- I suggest making the region size a box around the door, but not too large.
